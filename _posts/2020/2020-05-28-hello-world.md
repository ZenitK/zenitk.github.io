This is the very first blog post! Well, not really, but I do feel the need to write this down.

First of all, I hope you find here what you're looking for. 
Right now there isn't much content on the website, but hopefully, soon there will be plenty of good content about **search**, software engineering, **clean code**, 
reviews about online services, libraries, courses, and maybe some NLP goodness. 

I've been writing for a while now for myself, keeping somewhat structured notes that never get shared and get lost over time.
I hope that with this blog these notes will get more life and that they might be of some use to you.

For me, blogging is is a way to learn and share what I've learned. Just remembering ideas and concepts is hard, 
but writing them down in your own words and putting them into practice goes a long way in terms of learning.

There is a full backlog about topics, so please stay tuned! 
Here's the link to the [RSS Feed](https://www.zenitk.com/feed.xml), but regardless, stop by and say hello anytime.

If you've been looking to write your **own blog** check out this talk by [Khalid Abuhakmeh](https://khalidabuhakmeh.com/). 
Right now he's helping out new bloggers (as myself) to set up their blog and get going, so go and ask him about some tips!
