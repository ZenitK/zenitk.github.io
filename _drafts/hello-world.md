This is the very first blog post!

I hope you find here what you're looking for. 
For now there isn't much, but hopefuly soon there will be plenty of good content about Search, Software Engineering, Clean Coding, reviews about online services, libraries, courses, and maybe some NLP goodness. There is a full backlog about topics, so please stay tuned!

## Why?

First of all, for me, blogging is is a way to learn and share what I've learnt. Just remembering ideas and concepts is hard, but writing them down in your own words and putting them into practice goes a long way in terms of learning.

**TODO**
1. mention Khalid
2. mention Topics
